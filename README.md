# Water_quality_sensors_simulation
This program was made for a university project in which I was required to simulate the sensors from a drinking water quality system. To do this, I used python and tkinter library. The sensor values are randomly generated. The program checks if the generated values are within a desired range. If they are, a green led lights up, otherwise, a red one does the same. The user can set an interval(in sec) for how often the values update.
