# Water_quality_sensors_simulation
This program was made for an university project which required to simulate the sensors from a drinking water monitoring system.
In order to do this, I used python with tkinter library.
The program is designed to run from terminal, simply type "python Water_quality_sensors_simulation.py" and press the "Start simulation" button. If you want to stop the program, press "Stop simulation".
